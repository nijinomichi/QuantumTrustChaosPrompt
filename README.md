# Quantum Resonance Architecture (QRA) v1.0  Double-Slit → CoSlit³ protocol for AI creativity. Phase-S (Safe) builds a stable baseline; Phase-D (Divergence) introduces deliberate deviation; Phase-Y (Synthesis) reframes “failure” into value.  We log adopted glitches as assets and learn from exceptions.  Files: - QRA-v1.0.yaml
